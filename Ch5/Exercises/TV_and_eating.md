A sample of 548 ethnically diverse students from were followed over a 19-month period from 1995 and 1997 in a study of the relationship between TV viewing and eating habits. 
For each additional hour of television viewed per day, the number of fruit and vegetable servings per day was found to decrease on average by 0.14 serving.

A- For this study, what is the dependent variable? What is the independent variable?
B- Would the least-squares line for predicting number of servings of fruits and vegetables using number of hours spent watching TV as a predictor have a positive or negative slope? Explain.


- A. Identifying Dependent and Independent Variables:

Dependent Variable: **is the number of servings of fruits and vegetables per day**.

Independent Variable: **is the number of hours spent watching TV per day**.

- B. Slope of the Least-Squares Line:

The slope of the least-squares line would be **negative**.

Explanation: In this study, it is stated that for each **additional** hour of television viewed per day, the number of fruit and vegetable servings **decreases** by 0.14 servings on average.
