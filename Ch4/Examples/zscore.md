# How to Calculate Z-Score
Calculating a z-score requires that you first determine the mean and standard deviation of your data. Once you have these figures, you can calculate your z-score. So, assume you have the following variables:

x = 57

μ = 52

σ = 4

You would use the variables in the formula:

z = ( 57 - 52 ) / 4

z = 1.25

### So, your selected value has a z-score that indicates it is 1.25 standard deviations from the mean.

 |x |  Mean (μ)	|  St. Dev. (σ) |  Z-Score |
 |-------------|------------|----------------|----------------| 
 |3  |    12.17	    | 6.4 | -1.43 |
 |13 |  	12.17   | 6.4 | 0.13 |
 |8  | 	12.17   	| 6.4 | -0.65 |
 |21 |  	12.17   | 6.4 | 1.38 |
 |17 | 	12.17   	| 6.4 | 0.75 |
 |11 | 	12.17   	| 6.4 | -0.18 |
