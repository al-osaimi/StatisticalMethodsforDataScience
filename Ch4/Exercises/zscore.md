A class of students took a math exam, and the scores were normally distributed with a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 10. Sarah scored 85 on the exam.

Question:
1. What is the z-score for Sarah's exam result? Interpret what this z-score means in the context of the class.

2. Once you calculate the z-score, explain what this number represents in terms of Sarah's performance compared to the rest of the class.


Use the formula for the z-score:

$$
Z = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sigma}
$$

Where:
- $x_i$ is each data point,
- $\bar{x}$ is the mean,
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

$$
Z = \frac{85 - 75}{10} = 1
$$
