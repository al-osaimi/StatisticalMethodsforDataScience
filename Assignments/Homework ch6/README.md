# Ch6 – 6.3 Transmission Type Experiment

Consider the chance experiment in which the type of transmission—automatic (A) or manual (M)—is recorded for each of the next two cars 
purchased from a certain dealer.

a. What is the set of all possible outcomes (the sample space)? 

b. Display the possible outcomes in a tree diagram. 

c. List the outcomes in each of the following events. Which of these events are simple events? 

  i. B the event that at least one car has an automatic transmission 
  
   ii. C the event that exactly one car has an automatic transmission
  
   iii. D the event that neither car has an automatic transmission 
  
d. What outcomes are in the event B and C? In the event B or C? 


### a. Sample Space
Two types of transmission (automatic (A), manual (M)) and two cars:


S = \{(A, A), (A, M), (M, A), (M, M)\}


### b. Tree Diagram
      First Car
        /    \
      A       M
     / \     / \
    A   M   A   M

The outcomes from the tree diagram are:


S = \{(A, A), (A, M), (M, A), (M, M)\}


### c. Events and Classification
1. **Event B:** At least one car has an automatic transmission.
   
   
   B = \{(A, A), (A, M), (M, A)\}
   
   
   **Not a simple event** (contains multiple outcomes).

2. **Event C:** Exactly one car has an automatic transmission.
   
  
   C = \{(A, M), (M, A)\}
  
   
   **Not a simple event** (contains multiple outcomes).

3. **Event D:** Neither car has an automatic transmission.
 
   
   D = \{(M, M)\}
   
   
   **Simple event** (contains only one outcome).

### d. Combined Events
1. **Intersection of B and C ( B ∩ C):**
  
   B ∩ C = \{(A, M), (M, A)\}
  

2. **Union of B and C ( B ∪ C):**
   
   B ∪ C = \{(A, A), (A, M), (M, A)\}
